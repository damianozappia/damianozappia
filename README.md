### :computer: My Projects Portfolio :

#### An Adversarial Approach to Improve Instance Segmentation in Automotive
- The purpose of this work was to demonstrate how Instance Segmentation can be further improved allowing (in an autonomous driving context) the vehicle to count on a strong and reliable algorithm, that can help into choosing the right action while driving. The Instance Segmentation network is paired with a Generative Adversarial Network, using an Adversarial Approach framework, where the two networks are forced to compete and thus to improve each other.

#### The use of Keras Retinanet on the AVA dataset
- The aim of the project was to implement and utilize the Keras
RetinaNet, a one stage object detector that analysing images is
capable of recognising objects, actions etc inside them. The RetinaNet
has been used first with one of the default public datasets available for
objects classification (Pascal VOC), and then with the AVA dataset, to
classify actions inside pictures.

#### Eagle Flight - Graphical Application developed for Interactive Graphics course
- The project developed consists in the realization in computer graphics
of a low poly city with many animated items inside and relative
interactions implemented. This project has been carried out as final
project for the Interactive Graphics course at Sapienza Universit√† di
Roma.

#### Generative Adversarial Network for the creation of anime faces
- The aim was to build a GAN able to generate from scratch faces of
anime, with the ability to overcome the non convergence problems
that raise at resolution higher than 64x64 pixels, and adopting
strategies that allowed the generation of 128x128 pixels images, with a
good level of detail and realism.

#### Derivation of Kinematic Equations for KUKA youBot with "Pick and Place‚Äù implementation
- The aim of this project has been to develop a software using python
and ROS (Robot Operating System), that had the purpose of
computing the inverse kinematics for the KUKA YouBot, and use it to
perform a pick and place manipulation task, picking an object in a
given position and placing it in another specified position on the
robot's base.
